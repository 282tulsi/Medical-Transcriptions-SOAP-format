## About

Medical Transcription is the act of translating from oral to written form(on paper or electronically) the record of person's medical history, diagnosis, prognosis, and outcome in order to document patient health care and facilitate health care services. These documents eventually become part of paient's permanent files.

The SOAP note (an acronym for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan) is a method of documentation employed by healthcare providers to write out notes in a patient's chart, along with other common formats, such as the admission note.

Subjective sentences describe people's opinions, points-of-view, interpretations, comparisons, sentiments, judgments, appraisals or feelings toward entities, events and their properties.

Chief-Complaint : Previously scheduled appointments(annual check-up or follow-up) 
Follow up condition is classified based on doctor patient conversation consisting of greetings,salutations among the conversation.
