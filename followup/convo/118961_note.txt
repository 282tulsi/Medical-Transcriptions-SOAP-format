Okay, so uh, what we're going to be talking about is, um the, the new blood thinners because you have atrial fibrillation and, you know, Coumadin is a medicine that requires you to, um, have your blood tested once a week right, and it's expensive to get your blood tested, right? I know that. Okay, so the novel anticoagulants, uh, Pradaxa is one, the first one that came out, Pradaxa came out, uh, that started, uh, kind of came out like two years ago and the reason we give these blood thinners to people to, uh, prevent them from having strokes, right? And so, there is a risk of, there's a risk of stroke with atrial fibrillation that goes up as you get older and the risk of stroke goes up if you have diabetes and the risk of stroke goes up if you have high blood pressure and so we have, there's someone calling me, let me get this phone call [INAUDIBLE], uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] - [INAUDIBLE] to Medicare - Yeah. So, I think we can evaluate how we're talking about - [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE], okay. Okay, so um, the Pradaxa is a twice a day drug.
