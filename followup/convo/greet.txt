Good morning, Dr. Sharma! Good morning! What's wrong with you? I have been suffering from fever since yesterday. Do you have any other symptoms? I also feel headache and shivering. Let me take your temperature. At this time the fever is 102 degree. Don't worry, there is nothing serious. I am giving you the medicine, and you will be all right in couple of days. Thank you, doctor. But get your blood tested for malaria, and come with the report tomorrow. OK doctor. I shall recommend at least two days rest for you. Would you prepare a medical certificate for me to submit it in my office? Oh sure. This is your medical certificate. Thank you very much. Please tell me how shall I take this medicine? This medicine is for one day only. Take this dose as soon as you reach your home and the second at 3 pm and the third at night before sleeping. What should I eat doctor? You should eat only light food. You can take milk and fresh fruit also. How much shall I pay you doctor? You can pay consultation fee at the reception desk. Thanks doctor. It's all right. Thank you doctor. I shall see you tomorrow with my blood report.
