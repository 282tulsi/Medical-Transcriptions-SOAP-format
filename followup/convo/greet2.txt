Good evening, doctor. Will you send me some minutes? Of course., I will. I have been suffering from fever for a few days. What are the signs of a fever? When do you feel temperature? It’s usually between 5 to 6 pm. Do you feel any shivering sensation then? Yes, I do. Do you get thirst then? Yes, I get. I wish I could drink very cold water. When does the fever remit? At late hours of the night. Didn’t you take any sort of treatment? I was under the treatment of a village quack. Please, show me the prescription. He doesn’t give any written prescription. He only gave me some medicine. Could you tell me the names of the medicines he has prescribed? Sorry, sir. I can’t. But I can show you them, here are they. Oh, I see. He has prescribed you wrong medicines. Yours is malaria but he has given you the medicine of typhoid. Let me prescribe some medicines for you. Thank you, sir.
