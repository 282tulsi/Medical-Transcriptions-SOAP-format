Hello Ms Tulsi. I am Krithika, a Physician Assistant from Columbia hospital. You may remember that when you left, the Columbia hospital discharge educator, John, mentioned you'd receive a call checking in on things. I am hoping to talk to you about your medical issues, see how you are doing, and see if there is anything I can do to help you. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions so I can see if there is anything I can help you with?
